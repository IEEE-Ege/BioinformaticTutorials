    "\n",
    "Both the for-loop and the while-loop have different use cases. The for-loop is, as in the previous example, used to iterate over something. This can be a simple counter (a list of values), a list of strings, actually any object that is put into an iterable. So for-loops are to loop through a fixed list. A while-loop has a different purpose as it does not iterate through a list, but has a conditional that is tested before each iteration. If the condition is True, it will execute the code-block, and when the conditional is False, the while-loop is finished. A while-loop is used to continue iterating until for example a user presses a key or a certain precision has been achieved for a minimization process."

These types of methods take an iterable (such as a list) and return a new iterable with the applied manipulation.

Range() returns a special type of iterable, which is a range object ([it is not a generator](https://treyhunner.com/2018/02/python-range-is-not-an-iterator/)). In our previous examples, we supplied a list to the for-loop. This list is completely defined somewhere in memory and waiting to be referenced by the for-loop. If we would do the same with a large range of numbers, we first need to create this list. This can take a large chunk of memory, especially when we are iterating over millions of values (range(1e12)). For such cases, Python has generators, which is a form of ‘lazy execution’. Only when the value is required, i.e. when the for-loop asked for it, it is generated. While range has some subtle differences with generators, the idea is somewhat similar: only get the value you need, when you need it, without creating the full list of numbers first."

    "Similar to if-statements, for-loops can also be nested. Of course, you need to make sure that the variable for both for-loops are unique. The second for-loop starts in the next indentation level and this increases with each additional for-loop. While Python is fine with you adding large amounts of nested for-loops, in general, three is generally a good maximum. If you end up using more, it is time to look into strategies reducing the amount of looping. Looping is slow and if you need lots of looping, vectorization is probably what you want."

To call a function, you have to type its name with parenthesis after it. The name without the parenthesis is the reference which points to the function (everything in Python is an object remember?). A function can be called without parameters, meaning that there is nothing between the parenthesis. Many functions do however take one or more parameters and these can be supplied as variables or values, separated with a comma. Defining a function is done using the def keyword followed by a function name, a set of parenthesis, and a semicolon. All code is indented, similar to a for-loop or if-else statements. As a convention, the naming of a function is similar to variable names: all lower case with words separated using a underscore. Try to be short but concise. It is good practice to create a DocString for a function you create. Of course, it is not required when it is very clear what the function does, so use common sense when to create a DocString or comment to prevent over-commenting."

    "The parameters that a function takes are dynamically typed and are not restricted by Python itself. Of course, if you provide a string and the function tries to square the string, it will raise an error. Type checking is the responsibility of the user and is a good practice for code that is shared between multiple users, especially if the code base is large. For smaller projects and code only for you, you can choose not to do type checking, with a chance of getting bugs. Developers like to go even one step further and change the default dynamically typed behavior of Python into static types. Since Python 3.6 you can provide the types for each parameter and the return value in the function definition. While I understand the benefit for debugging, I have never bothered. I guess with larger programs it might be more important, but for data science purposes I think data integrity is more important than static typing. On the other side, it is not to much work to apply. Here is a [great guide on static typing](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/learn-how-to-use-static-type-checking-in-python-3-6-in-10-minutes-12c86d72677b) in Python. Sometimes the dynamical typing is used as a benefit. A function can test for its type and do different things for different objects. Many packages like Numpy or Pandas use this to create an array or DataFrame from different datatypes. If we would statically type this, we would have to create different functions for each datatype. Dynamical typing can be a blessing, but it can also be a burden according to others. I have never found it problematic for any of my use cases."

    "Another way to provide parameters to a function is to use named parameters. These are also called key — value parameters and start with the defined parameter name followed by an equal sign and the assigned value or variable. For short functions, i.e. function with only one or two parameters, people do not really bother but when it is a complex function with many parameters, these help tremendously with readability. As the parameters are assigned explicitly, the order in which they are provided does not matter. If you for some reason match named parameters with standard sequential parameters, the order does matter, so you should be careful when doing this. In a similar manor, default values can also be provided in the definition of the function. This makes the parameter optional, as it already has a value assigned. All parameters that do not have a default value, are automatically flagged as required parameters and an error will be raised if they are not provided. Another common practice is to assign the None type as a default value. This makes the parameter optional and in the function itself you can test if the parameter is of type None or something else and act accordingly. Of course, such idioms are quite specific in their use case."
